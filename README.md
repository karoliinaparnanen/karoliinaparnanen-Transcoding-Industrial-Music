| **Physical Description** | VHS. 60 min. 
| **Type** | Visual Document
| **Medium** | Video
| **Materials** | Plastic, magnetic tape, paper.
| **Date** | 1987
|![VHS cover](<img src="Transcoding%20Industrial%20Music/extremeart6.jpg">)| The washed out pink, purple, blue, white and black shaded cover image shows a video still closeup of a man's face. From the camera's perspective, the man is looking down on the viewer with half-closed eyelids. His mouth is relaxed. The strong contrast, half washed out face and pixels that remind one of an 80's television screen make the image of him appear dreamlike, ecstatic and intentionally grunfy and careless. The title "Extreme Art Industrial Compilation" is spread through the top part with a black type, whose serifs are sharp like knives. The number "1" stands isolated in a bigger size on the lower left corner. The dimensions of the VHS tape inside are 18.7 × 10.2 × 2.5 cm.

|![VHS cover](<img src="Transcoding%20Industrial%20Music/extremeart6.jpg">)| The washed out purple, blue, white and black shaded cover image shows a a video still of a photographic, ghost-like figure approaching the viewer with open hands. The figure is heavily lit from the back, so any details of the figure are not visible. The black figure's silhouette is visible over a light, almost white background. the image quality resembles that of an 80's television screen capture. The title "Extreme Art Industrial Compilation" is spread through the top part with a black type, whose serifs are sharp like knives. The number "2" stands isolated in a bigger size on the lower left corner. The dimensions of the VHS tape inside are 18.7 × 10.2 × 2.5 cm.

## Ideology of Industrial Music
The birth of industrial music was a response to an age in which the access and control of information were becoming the primary tools of power. As an artistic movement, it has formed due to the simultaneous fear and fascination of **how the information revolution and the effects of the age of mechanical reproduction affects the human condition and social consciousness.** As the purpose of all art is to expand the beholder's perception, so was the purpose of industrial music to help the listener achieve a better understanding and awareness of **how the advent of technology influences his view of the world.** **Industrial musicians “create particular modernist aesthetics that attempt **to comprehend and comment on what came to be known as the ‘modern crisis’ of the twentieth century.** Instead of rallying youth behind political slogans, **industrial artists preferred to “decondition” the individual listener by confronting taboos.** 

## Visual aesthetics of Industrial Music
Industrial music draws on harsh, transgressive or provocative sounds and themes. It is a form of **anti-music**, descendant of **da-da**, **surrealist** and **performance art** and an artistic yet intellectual manifestation of **nihilism**.  The industrial musicians created a particular modernist aesthetics that attemted to comprehend and comment on what came to be known as the "modern" crisis of the twentieth century". 

## Auditory Aesthetics of Industrial Music
At its birth, the genre of industrial music was different from any other music, and its **use of technology and disturbing lyrics and themes to tear apart preconceptions about the necessary rules of musical** form supports seeing industrial music as modernist music.  Industrial music also got known for its unconventional use of instruments, often including self-modified instruments and so-called **non-intruments** or found objects, which could be any objects the artist felt fitting to create auditory atmospheres. Use of drones and noise was popular. It often combined electronic instruments, such as **the keyoard and computer programming with electric guitars, bass, drums and vocals**. Lyrics were often present, but not easily understood word by word. The literal text of the lyrics was less important than creating an atmosphere were the listener could let go of their preconceptions of music and taste. 

The VHS tape includes an impressive overview of different stylistic methods, musical and visual approaches to industrial music. Its anarchist atmosphere enabled a rich variety of subgenres to develop, such as Substyles inspirted by industrial music include dark ambient, power electronics, Japanoise, neofolk, electro-industrial, electronic body music, industrial hip hop, industrial rock, industrial metal, industrial pop, martial industrial, power noise, and witch house..

## About industrial music

The birth of industrial music was a response to an age in which the access and control of information were becoming the primary tools of power. Industrial music draws on harsh, transgressive or provocative sounds and themes. It is a form of **anti-music**, descendant of **da-da**, **surrealist** and **performance art** and an artistic (yet intellectual) manifestation of **nihilism**. As an artistic movement, it has formed due to the simultaneous fear and fascination of **how the information revolution and the effects of the age of mechanical reproduction affects the human condition and social consciousness.** **I**ndustrial musicians “create particular modernist aesthetics that attempt **to comprehend and comment on what came to be known as the ‘modern crisis’ of the twentieth century.”**

At its birth, the genre of industrial music was different from any other music, and its **use of technology and disturbing lyrics and themes to tear apart preconceptions about the necessary rules of musical** form supports the suggestion that industrial music is modernist music. Instead of rallying youth behind political slogans, **industrial artists preferred to “decondition” the individual listener by confronting taboos.** As the purpose of all art is to expand the beholder's perception, so was the purpose of industrial music to help the listener achieve a better understanding and awareness of **how the advent of technology influences his view of the world.** 

## Personal interest & research questions

- Why do specific kinds of music styles emerge in specific times? What does music tell about the society and the culture around it?
- How does the death of a medium affect the disappearance/relevance of certain subcultures?

# Transcoding directions

## 1. "Upcycling" industrial music

- Sampling the music to create a new track that fits in the contemporary music aesthetic
- Making industrial music trendy again
- Why? Criticising pop culture and how it takes things out of context and uses them for its benefit without a proper respect of copyrights.

## 2. Preserving industrial music

- Creating a virtual reality experience with Unity.
- A house where one can experience the time of industrial music
- Why? To preserve a memory of a culture that got marginalized. To translate something very analog into something very digital.
- How to translate the DIY culture of industrial music to the Unity environment. Aesthetics of the subculture vs Aesthetics of the online world.

## 3. Transforming industrial music

- Feeding the source material to an artificial intelligence algorithm to see what kind of music it creates.

# Transcoding experiments

Click image to play video. Recreating this performance from the Extreme Art VHS. 

2. After that the user sees my own physical recreation of this performance.

3. Finally the user enters the 3D simulation of this performance.

## 3. Transforming

### 3.1 Creating a sample pack with AI using the music from VHS using Python
[AI music tool GitHub](https://github.com/maxfrenzel/SampleVAE/blob/master/README.md)
Creates 2 second samples based on the imput material.

Training the data set with music sample works when I go to the SampleVAE folder.

Why is it on (base)?

<img src="Transcoding%20Industrial%20Music/env.png" width="600"> </br>
When I try to go on my "tutorial-env" folder (that I created following a "create a virtual Python environment" tutorial) where the SampleVAE program is it doesn't work.
<img src="Transcoding%20Industrial%20Music/envSampleVAE.png" width="600"></br>
How do I run the program on my computer? From which location should I operate in terminal to run the command "from tool_class import *"? It doesn't work if I go to the "SampleVAE" folder.
