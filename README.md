## About industrial music

The birth of industrial music was a response to an age in which the access and control of information were becoming the primary tools of power. Industrial music draws on harsh, transgressive or provocative sounds and themes. It is a form of **anti-music**, descendant of **da-da**, **surrealist** and **performance art** and an artistic (yet intellectual) manifestation of **nihilism**. As an artistic movement, it has formed due to the simultaneous fear and fascination of **how the information revolution and the effects of the age of mechanical reproduction affects the human condition and social consciousness.** **I**ndustrial musicians “create particular modernist aesthetics that attempt **to comprehend and comment on what came to be known as the ‘modern crisis’ of the twentieth century.”**

At its birth, the genre of industrial music was different from any other music, and its **use of technology and disturbing lyrics and themes to tear apart preconceptions about the necessary rules of musical** form supports the suggestion that industrial music is modernist music. Instead of rallying youth behind political slogans, **industrial artists preferred to “decondition” the individual listener by confronting taboos.** As the purpose of all art is to expand the beholder's perception, so was the purpose of industrial music to help the listener achieve a better understanding and awareness of **how the advent of technology influences his view of the world.** 

## Personal interest & research questions

- Why do specific kinds of music styles emerge in specific times? What does music tell about the society and the culture around it?
- How does the death of a medium affect the disappearance/relevance of certain subcultures?

# Transcoding directions

## 1. "Upcycling" industrial music

- Sampling the music to create a new track that fits in the contemporary music aesthetic
- Making industrial music trendy again
- Why? Criticising pop culture and how it takes things out of context and uses them for its benefit without a proper respect of copyrights.

## 2. Preserving industrial music

- Creating a virtual reality experience with Unity.
- A house where one can experience the time of industrial music
- Why? To preserve a memory of a culture that got marginalized. To translate something very analog into something very digital.
- How to translate the DIY culture of industrial music to the Unity environment. Aesthetics of the subculture vs Aesthetics of the online world.

## 3. Transforming industrial music

- Feeding the source material to an artificial intelligence algorithm to see what kind of music it creates.
